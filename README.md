**Author:** The French Monkey (TFMSTYLE)  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## Overview

The Maze Generator creates procedural mazes using either **rectangular** or **circular** layouts.  
Each maze is fully parametric and can be regenerated interactively using a live-update system.  
The add-on employs classical algorithms such as **Depth-First Search (DPS)** and **Kruskal’s Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** to produce distinct maze topologies.  

This generator is ideal for game design, visualizations, and procedural world-building where modular maze patterns or labyrinthine forms are required.

## Parameters

### Live Update
When enabled, automatically rebuilds the maze in real-time as parameters are changed.  
Disable for heavy mazes to improve performance.

---

### Maze Size
Controls the overall scaling of the generated maze in Blender units.  
Affects both the width and height proportionally.

---

### Corridor Spacing
Defines the spacing between adjacent maze paths.  
Larger values create wider gaps between corridors.

---

### Wall Size
Applies a solidify modifier to the walls.  
Controls their physical thickness in the final mesh.

---

### Wall Height
Determines how tall the maze walls are extruded upward from the base plane.

---

### Seed
Randomization seed for the maze generation algorithm.  
Changing this value creates a new unique maze while preserving other settings.

---

## Maze Type

### Shape
Specifies the overall shape of the maze structure.  
Available options:
- **Rectangular:** Generates a square or rectangular grid maze.  
- **Circular:** Generates a concentric ring (polar) maze.

---

## Maze Style

### Style
Selects which algorithm is used to carve the maze’s pathways.  
Available options:
- **DPS (Depth-First Search):** Creates long, winding corridors with few dead ends.  
- **Kruskal:** Produces a more uniform and balanced network of paths.

---

## Rectangular Maze Parameters

### Width
Number of cells horizontally across the rectangular maze grid.

---

### Height
Number of cells vertically across the rectangular maze grid.

---

### Inner Width
Defines an inner excluded area (hole) in the rectangular maze where no walls are generated along the X-axis.

---

### Inner Height
Defines the excluded area along the Y-axis for rectangular mazes.  
Together with Inner Width, this can create ring-like or hollow mazes.

---

## Circular Maze Parameters

### Outer Diameter
Sets the outermost boundary size of the circular maze.  
Larger values produce more rings and overall maze complexity.

---

### Inner Diameter
Defines the diameter of the inner void (center hole).  
Can be set to zero for a fully filled maze, or increased to create donut-shaped labyrinths.

---

## Operators

### Generate Maze
Creates a new maze object or rebuilds the selected one using current parameter values.  
Automatically names the object based on the maze type and style.

---

### Reset Sliders
Resets all numeric properties to their default values.  
If **Live Update** is active, the maze regenerates immediately.

---

### Delete Selected Maze
Deletes the currently selected maze object generated by the add-on.

## Behavior & Workflow

1. Adjust the **Maze Type** to choose between rectangular and circular layouts.  
2. Set the **Width** and **Height** (for rectangular) or **Outer/Inner Diameter** (for circular).  
3. Choose a **Maze Style** — *DPS* for organic mazes, *Kruskal* for uniform structures.  
4. Modify **Corridor Spacing**, **Wall Height**, and **Wall Size** for physical proportions.  
5. Use **Seed** to randomize the maze structure while preserving layout parameters.  
6. Click **Generate Maze** to build or update the geometry.  
7. Enable **Live Update** to preview parameter adjustments instantly.  
8. Optionally apply materials, modifiers, or use the result in game or animation environments.

## Technical Notes

- The generated mesh is a pure geometry network, suitable for export or further modeling.  
- Walls are constructed procedurally using **bmesh** and optionally solidified via Blender’s **Solidify modifier**.  
- Algorithms:
  - **DPS (Depth-First Search):** Carves one continuous path before backtracking.  
  - **Kruskal:** Randomly connects edges while maintaining a single connected network.  
- Circular mazes are generated using polar coordinates, with adjustable inner and outer diameters.  
- The system automatically syncs between the active maze object and property panel values.

## Usage Notes

- For large mazes, disable **Live Update** while adjusting sliders.  
- Adjust **Wall Height** and **Wall Size** to control the visual prominence of maze structures.  
- Set **Inner Width/Height** or **Inner Diameter** to create ring-shaped or hollow mazes.  
- Each maze is stored as a standard Blender mesh and can be edited, sculpted, or textured as usual.  
- Works well for procedural environments, architectural elements, or stylized design assets.
